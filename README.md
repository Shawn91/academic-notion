Are you tired of copying and pasting info of research papers into your Notion database?

Visit [Chrome Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/academic-notion/gcgpnidgdaihkdebbccieaelpjomhfpg) to download [Academic Notion](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/academic-notion/gcgpnidgdaihkdebbccieaelpjomhfpg).

Academic Notion automates this process for you, so you can use Notion like a real reference management software like Zotero.

3. Authorize Academic Notion to access your database and set the correspondence between columns of your database and fields of a paper. (This step only needs to be done once.)

4. Click 'UPLOAD'.

Note: Academic Notion is still in an early stage. The currently supported platforms are:

More platforms will be supported.
